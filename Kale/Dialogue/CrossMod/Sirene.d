== BC0Siren @3 // ~That is... well, even t'were truly the case, I am fighting to defend my allies, not mutilate my foes.~

== BC0Siren @5 // ~Indeed, and in that, perhaps you may understand why I prefer calmness in battle. I would not like to lose myself in battle and have another suffer harm.~
== X3KaleB @6 // ~Ha, you knightly lots are bloody stubborn about the smallest things. Sure I can't tempt you to try: "Have a taste of devilish death!" at least once?~
== BC0Siren @7 // ~No, thank you.~
