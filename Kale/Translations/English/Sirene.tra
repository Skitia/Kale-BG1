// Sirene-Kale 1
@0 = ~Y'know, Sirene, maybe you should try shouting sometimes.~
@1 = ~Iâ€”I beg your pardon?~
@2 = ~Shouting. Like in battle. Your swings pack twice the punch when you lead with a nice loud shout. Completely true, every hero does it.~
@3 = ~That is... well, even t'were truly the case, I am fighting to defend my allies, not mutilate my foes.~
@4 = ~Pfft, come on. I wield a big sword. You wield a bigger sword. We don't have much in common, but we're both good ol' scrappers in the frontlines, wouldn't you agree?~
@5 = ~Indeed, and in that, perhaps you may understand why I prefer calmness in battle. I would not like to lose myself in battle and have another suffer harm.~
@6 = ~Ha, you knightly lots are bloody stubborn about the smallest things. Sure I can't tempt you to try: "Have a taste of devilish death!" at least once?~
@7 = ~No, thank you.~
