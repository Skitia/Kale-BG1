@0    = ~Kale NPC for BG1EE and SoD~
@1 = ~Kale~
@2 = ~Kale claps his hand on your back and almost eagerly launches into his story. Born faster, stronger, and more courageous than the rest of Gullykin combined, he describes himself as a daredevil and ladies' man, listing exploits of strength and flashing scar after scar. While the other hin of Gullykin were more homebodies or expert cons, Kale quickly realized his peerless strength and flashed it as his feat of mettle. Still, you have a feeling he is exaggerating when he begins to describe the process of slaying a wyvern with a sword into it's hindquarters blindfolded. He ends with how proud his mother is, obviously very fond of her as he goes into how much she gushes over his stories.~

@45 = ~warden~
@46 = ~Warden~
@47 = ~WARDEN: The warden is a warrior whose discipline and traditions center around fighting in pairs. The warden takes on the defensive role in the pair, while the ward receives elevated offensive prowess. Their remarkable protective talents come at the cost of the wardenâ€™s skill with weapons being inferior to other fighter traditions.
