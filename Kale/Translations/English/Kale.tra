@0    = ~Kale NPC for BG1EE and SoD~
@1 = ~Kale~
@2 = ~Kale claps his hand on your back and almost eagerly launches into his story. Born faster, stronger, and more courageous than the rest of Gullykin combined, he describes himself as a daredevil and ladies' man, listing exploits of strength and flashing scar after scar. While the other hin of Gullykin were more homebodies or expert cons, Kale quickly realized his peerless strength and flashed it as his feat of mettle. Still, you have a feeling he is exaggerating when he begins to describe the process of slaying a wyvern with a sword into it's hindquarters blindfolded. He ends with how proud his mother is, obviously very fond of her as he goes into how much she gushes over his stories.~

@46 = ~Warden~
@47 = ~Warden: A warrior tradition placing emphasis on fighting in pairs, these warriors work best with a partner next to them, who they choose to elevate their ability in combat. The Warden takes on the defensive role in the pair, while their partner, 
	the Ward, receives elevated offensive prowess. This comes at the cost of the own Wardenâ€™s skill with weapons being inferior to other fighter traditions, but there are few other partners one would wish to stand next to.

The bonuses vary on level. It does not stack with itself, and if the ward is changed, the previous ward loses their bonuses. 
	Level 1: The Ward receives +1 Damage bonus, -1 Thaco. The Warden receives penalties for the same amount, but gains 10% resistance to physical damage and regenerates 1 Hitpoint per 6 seconds.
